#Better Chat Colors
I decided to make this plugin because when looking around for a decent plugin that allowed players to change
their chat color through a gui I couldn't really find anything that was bug free, supported MySql, supported 1.16
hex codes & had a customizable gui. So I decided to make this for my server. 

As it stands this plugin only supports 1.16 + simply because it is required for the hex colors to work.
But later on I plan to release this plugin to spigotmc.org and when I do that I might end up creating a version that
works on 1.13+, but until then it will only be for 1.16+.
